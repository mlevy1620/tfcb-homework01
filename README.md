Regarding the tidy data frame we were asked to make, using tab-delimited csv format with linux line endings: I was able to export a .csv file and convert to linux line endings, or esport as a .txt file and convert to linux line endings, but when I converted a .txt file back to a .csv it looked wrong on github.
